Features I tried to Incorporate:

- Plenty of practice with material UI for frontend development. 
- Used react-router-dom, BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, useNavigate
- Used redux and redux toolkit
- Utilized react-hook-forms, there were several benefits which include cleaner code than react-forms, simple validations, easy to watch the particular field, display errors on the front end and console, and even watch fields which have been interacted with.
- Practice with creating 2 reducers in my store.js file, and had 2 slices for my user as well for my mail functionality

Issues I Faced:
- I was not able to format the time for the emails
